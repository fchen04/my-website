        <h2>More About My Interests</h2>
        <p>My interest in the intersection of Data Science and Biology is deeply rooted in my passion for understanding cancer and rare variant diseases. As a combined Data Science and Biology student at Northeastern University, I am particularly fascinated by how data-driven approaches can be used to uncover the genetic underpinnings of these complex conditions and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.

            In oncology, I am driven by the challenge of identifying genetic mutations and alterations that drive cancer progression. By applying bioinformatics tools to analyze large-scale genomic data, such as whole genome sequencing or transcriptomics, we can uncover novel cancer-associated genes and pathways. These discoveries could lead to the development of targeted therapies that are more effective and have fewer side effects than traditional treatments, offering new hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers.
            
            I am also passionate about rare variant diseases, where the genetic causes are often elusive and poorly understood. By leveraging advanced data science techniques to analyze rare variants in patient genomes, we can uncover genetic mutations that contribute to these rare diseases. This knowledge can lead to better diagnostic tools, more accurate genetic counseling, and even potential therapeutic interventions for these underserved conditions.
            
            Ultimately, I am excited about the potential of combining genomics and data science to uncover new insights in cancer and rare diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostics, treatments, and patient care.</p>
