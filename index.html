        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Fiona Chen, and I am currently a combined Data Science and Biology student at Northeastern University. This site is a reflection of my passion for both fields and the exciting intersection between them. I have always been fascinated by the power of data and how it can be used to unlock insights into the complexities of biology.

            Specifically, my primary focus is on bioinformatics and genomics, where I delve into the intricacies of the human genome, exploring novel gene-disease correlations. The idea that we can harness the power of data to better understand human health and disease is both inspiring and motivating. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep interest in how genomic discoveries can be translated into actionable therapeutics to improve human health.
            
            This website serves as a space where I can showcase some of the work I have done, whether in research, projects, or academic achievements. It also allows me to share my thoughts, ideas, and progress as I continue to grow in this exciting field. I am excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities that lie at the intersection of data science and biology, and I look forward to making meaningful contributions to the world of bioinformatics. </p>
